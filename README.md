# odin-recipes
This is the first project from The Odin Project Foundations course. My goal is to familiarize myself with using Github, VS Code, and Terminal. The resources that I used are: The Odin Project, Google, and Youtube.

## What I Learned
**Through this project, I learned the following concepts:**
* Using VSCode Shortcuts (Emmet Abbreviation and Keyboard Shortcuts) to code more efficiently
* Using Live Preview to view my progress and if everything works
* Review on the following:
    - Creating a Repository on Github
    - Using Terminal to connect to Github and to create new directories, files, etc.
    - Formatting HTML
    - Adding link and images
    - Using different elements on HTML
* Formatting a README.md file to make it look good

## My Struggles
**There were some bumps along the way. I have listed my struggles below and if I have solved them, the solution/s is/are on the bullet/s below.**
* ***Terminal commands:*** I struggled to understand how to properly use Terminal (5.14.22)
    - Now that I look back at what I typed, I can see what I did wrong: 
        - I failed to use the commands cd ~ and cd repos/ and Terminal responded with "command not found" when I just typed repos
        - I thought I didn't have one so I used mkdir repos and Terminal responded with "File exists"
        - I already created a repos folder when I set up my Github account and I was searching for it
        - Accidentally making the folder in git_test since I was trying to follow The Odin Project's Git Basics page and I mixed up the tasks from Git Basics and the Recipe Project
* ***Source Control:*** There are so many options with VS Code and Terminal (5.14.22)
    - I have not memorized the Terminal commands yet to be able to commit on Github, but through updating the README.md I am understanding more
    - Staging changes and Committing with VS Code is way simpler and I love it, but I eventually need to get better with using Terminal
* ***Understanding the differences with Staging, Committing, and Pushing:*** I wrongly believed that commit was the final step to see the changes on Github (5.14.22)
    - Staging sets up for Commit, Commit sets up for Pushing, Pushing publishes the changes on Github
    - Initially I thought that after Committing it should already be published and I was waiting for the changes to appear
    - I went back to Terminal and typed the command git push then I finally saw the changes on the README.md file and I was happy that I learned something new
        - ***Unstaging:*** I did my first unstaging due to a typo and learned that it's not complicated
