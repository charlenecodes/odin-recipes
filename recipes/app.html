        <div class="intro">
            <p>Lumpia is one of the most famous Filipino food. It is well known by locals and foreigners since it is a great finger food. In our family, it barely makes it to the table because before it even cools down someone is already biting into the piping hot lumpia.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ing">
            To make the classic Filipino lumpia, you will need the following:
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 kg ground pork</li>
                <li>2 onions, minced</li>
                <li>2 carrots</li>
                <li>1.5 tsp salt, to taste</li>
                <li>1.5 tsp chicken powder</li>
                <li>50 pcs. (one pack) of Lumpia wrappers</li>
                <li>a bowl of water (for rolling)</li>
                <li>vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
                
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="recipe">
            <ol>
                <li>The first step is to mince the carrots and onions into fine pieces. Using a food processor is optional, but it works well and makes it faster.</li>
                <li>Next, combine the pork, minced onions and carrots, chicken powder, and salt. Once it has been throroughly mixed, make sure to pan fry a small piece and make sure it tastes good already. Add additional salt to taste.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We all have different taste preferences. Some families choose to add more seasonings, but this is how we make it at home and if we find it lacks flavor we just add a pinch of salt or chicken powder at a time until it's perfect.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Once the flavor of the lumpia suits your taste, the hard work begins. You have to roll the lumpia into the wrapper.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The best technique is to have the square wrapper in a diamond shape in front of you.</li>
                        <li>Then place a small ball of the meat mixture. To prevent from getting your hands dirty use the wrapper to roll the meat onto the bottom edge of the wrapper closest to you and start rolling it forward.</li>
                        <li>If you are satisfied with the length of the lumpia you want to bring the right and left corners towards the middle until you reach the end of the wrapper.</li>
                        <li>Before you roll it all the way to the end, use your fingers to dab a bit of water to make sure that the ends stick together to prevent it opening during frying.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>After rolling all the meat into the wrapper, you are ready to fry! Heat the skillet and the oil until there are small bubbles that appear when you place the tongs in the oil.</li>
                <li>Fry the lumpia for a few minutes on each side until golden brown. It is important to watch the heat so the outside doesn't cook faster than the inside.</li>
                <li>Finally, enjoy your lumpia and share (if you'd like)! ðŸ¥³</li>
